## Design

### Design Choices

My layout decisions were informed by development principles of presenting clear accessible information, using repetition and contrast to create a memorable and easily navigated site, and first-look learning. My decisions on the style and theming of the website were informed by the perspective of the site owner wanting to create a certain brand image; I have aimed for a relaxing, sophisticated aesthetic for a culturally leaning business. 

### Colours

I have chosen an analogous colour scheme for the site, emphasising a simplicity and gentle atmosphere that matches the brand image. The colours chosen are muted and warm pastel colours, intended to be soothing, with a darker accent colour to create some contrast and draw attention to structural layout information. I chose a yellow analogous colour scheme for a positive and relaxing tone.

Main theme colour: #fbefcc

Accent theme colour: #f7e09d

### Fonts

My two fonts for the website were selected from Google Fonts' sans-serif collection. I wanted to use fonts that presented a very clean, spacious look for the headings and text. The fonts I chose were those that I felt best matched the cohesive brand theming of the website and the accessibility focused design principles that informed the entire design process. I chose a more stylistic, lightweight typeface for the headings as the text is both larger, and thus easier to read, and more prominent as an aesthetic presence on the page.

### Structure 

The website is designed to feel like one cohesive page, as much as that is possible. I have focused on consistency across all four pages of the site, again, as much as possible; each page shares a header and footer, uses the same design for page headings, and follows the same basic layout principles using the Bootstrap grid system. The website is navigated by using a clear, easy-to-use navigation bar at the top of the page. This principle of a consistent site experience is also the reason I chose to display the different content on the 'Our Teas' page as tabpanels with its own navigation bar; I aimed to create a similar experience navigating to different pages as the user has when changing tabs, where only the necessary content changes. 

The content I considered important enough to remain consistent across all pages is as follows:

- A header with the site logo, and on desktop an additional title for the page the user is currently viewing
- A navigation bar to access the different pages of the site
- A footer with the business address to be more memorable
- A short business tagline to reinforce the business ethos
- Links to the business social media pages

The site consists of four different pages and a unique 404 error page.

1. Homepage - a memorable landing page to grip the user's attention and communicate useful information on first glance
2. Our Teas - a menu page that shows users what teas are on offer at the business 
3. Events - a page that shows both upcoming and past events, advertising the kind of events people are able to attend, and showcasing the events space to potential tenants
4. Contact - a contact form for questions and business inquiries

### Header and Navigation

- The navigation bar is featured on every page to allow consistent navigation around the site
- All pages are linked with the currently active page highlighted with a dark font colour
- On larger screen sizes, the header responsively adds a stylistic page title to the header. On smaller screen sizes this is not displayed to create a cleaner look without clutter
- On smaller screen sizes, the responsive navigation bar collapses into an easy-to-use hamburger menu

### Company Ethos

- Three images with overlaid text that aims to give the user a clear idea of what the business is offering and the unique value it has
- Images contribute to the brand image of cultural appreciation, text conveys each of the three main points of company ethos 
- On larger screen sizes these are presented in three static columns, creating a cohesive and clean visual, and allowing the user to read at leisure
- On smaller screen sizes these images are presented on an automatically rotating carousel, to grab the user's attention and display all three without taking up three times the screen space on smaller devices. The carousel plays automatically upon loading the page but pauses on hover to make the content more accessible
