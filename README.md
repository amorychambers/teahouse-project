## Design

### Design Choices

My layout decisions were informed by development principles of presenting clear accessible information, using repetition and contrast to create a memorable and easily navigated site, and first-look learning. My decisions on the style and theming of the website were informed by the perspective of the site owner wanting to create a certain brand image; I have aimed for a relaxing, sophisticated aesthetic for a culturally leaning business. 

### Colours

I have chosen an analogous colour scheme for the site, emphasising a simplicity and gentle atmosphere that matches the brand image. The colours chosen are muted and warm pastel colours, intended to be soothing, with a darker accent colour to create some contrast and draw attention to structural layout information. I chose a yellow analogous colour scheme for a positive and relaxing tone.

Main theme colour: #fbefcc

Accent theme colour: #f7e09d

### Fonts

My two fonts for the website were selected from Google Fonts' sans-serif collection. I wanted to use fonts that presented a very clean, spacious look for the headings and text. The fonts I chose were those that I felt best matched the cohesive brand theming of the website and the accessibility focused design principles that informed the entire design process. I chose a more stylistic, lightweight typeface for the headings as the text is both larger, and thus easier to read, and more prominent as an aesthetic presence on the page.

[Zen Maru Gothic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zen+Maru+Gothic)

[Poiret One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One?query=poiret+one)

### Structure 

The website is designed to feel like one cohesive page, as much as that is possible. I have focused on consistency across all four pages of the site, again, as much as possible; each page shares a header and footer, uses the same design for page headings, and follows the same basic layout principles using the Bootstrap grid system. The website is navigated by using a clear, easy-to-use navigation bar at the top of the page. This principle of a consistent site experience is also the reason I chose to display the different content on the 'Our Teas' page as tabpanels with its own navigation bar; I aimed to create a similar experience navigating to different pages as the user has when changing tabs, where only the necessary content changes. 

The content I considered important enough to remain consistent across all pages is as follows:

- A header with the site logo, and on desktop an additional title for the page the user is currently viewing
- A navigation bar to access the different pages of the site
- A footer with the business address to be more memorable
- A short business tagline to reinforce the business ethos
- Links to the business social media pages

The site consists of four different pages and a unique 404 error page.

1. Homepage - a memorable landing page to grip the user's attention and communicate useful information on first glance
2. Our Teas - a menu page that shows users what teas are on offer at the business 
3. Events - a page that shows both upcoming and past events, advertising the kind of events people are able to attend, and showcasing the events space to potential tenants
4. Contact - a contact form for questions and business inquiries

## Features

### Header and Navigation

- The navigation bar is featured on every page to allow consistent navigation around the site
- All pages are linked with the currently active page highlighted with a dark font colour
- On larger screen sizes, the header responsively adds a stylistic page title to the header. On smaller screen sizes this is not displayed to create a cleaner look without clutter
- On smaller screen sizes, the responsive navigation bar collapses into an easy-to-use hamburger menu


![Desktop header](design/features/header-desktop.png)

![Mobile header](design/features/header-mobile.png)

### Landing Page

- Main feature is a hero image with text that aims to immediately present the user with the brand image of a relaxing, sophisticated establishment
- Text spacing responsively adjusts to different screen sizes for consistent styling across all devices

![Hero image](design/features/hero-image.png)

### Ethos Images

- Three images with overlaid text that aims to give the user a clear idea of what the business is offering and the unique value it has
- Images contribute to the brand image of cultural appreciation, text conveys each of the three main points of company ethos 
- On larger screen sizes these are presented in three static columns, creating a cohesive and clean visual, and allowing the user to read at leisure
- On smaller screen sizes these images are presented on an automatically rotating carousel, to grab the user's attention and display all three without taking up three times the screen space on smaller devices. The carousel plays automatically upon loading the page but pauses on hover to make the content more accessible 

![Three column display of ethos images for desktop](design/features/ethos-desktop.png)

## Testing

### HTML Validation

Validated with the W3C Markup Validation Service

index.html [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Famorychambers.github.io%2Fteahouse-project%2Findex.html)
The validator lists six errors for this page, because in the carousel code snippet from Bootstrap v5.3 it was more practical to use six img elements for the carousel slides, as opposed to using a CSS background. These images do not have an alt text, in the same way any other background image would not, as the relevant textual content and context is already present as a paragraph element overlaying the slide.

### CSS Validation

Validated with the W3C CSS Validation Service

The CSS validation service lists 16 errors that are common and distinct to Bootstrap content, which I have used on the site. 

When validating my own style.css document by direct upload, it returns no errors.

### Accessibility

Validated with the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools

index.html [Results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://amorychambers.github.io/teahouse-project/)

The accessibility tool lists six errors for missing alt text on images; as discussed above this is a consequence of the Bootstrap carousel slides using img elements as a background rather than using a CSS property, which do not need alt texts. I am confident that these errors are therefore not a legitimate accessibility concern, as much as they are a quirk of the Bootstrap carousel code snippet I have chosen to use. The other four contrast errors are similarly caused by the use of an img element as a background rather than a CSS background; the accessibility tool is checking the contrast of the text against the background colour of the site, as opposed to the actual background colour of the img element used. Whilst this presents a valid learning experience going forward to be more mindful of accessibility when using code snippets, in this project I have decided that as it does not present an actual accessibility error on the page, it does not need to be corrected.

our-teas.html [Results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://amorychambers.github.io/teahouse-project/our-teas.html)

The accessibility tool lists one contrast error, for low contrast between the page heading and the background image. Addressed by increasing the font size and font weight to be more readable.

events.html [Results](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://amorychambers.github.io/teahouse-project/events.html)

The accessibility tool lists one contrast error, for low contrast between the page heading and the background image. Addressed by increasing the font size and font weight to be more readable.

### Performance

Performance testing by Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools

The maximum performance I could achieve for the index and our-teas pages using the minimal Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files was 87 and 84. The Bootstrap framework was incredibly useful and efficient in creating the site, but the large stylesheets it has to load create a long render delay. I was able to improve performance on all pages by moving the Font Awesome script from the head of the HTML to the bottom of the body, and by using an undisplayed img element to force the browser to load the background hero image faster, as this was the LCP.

index.html
![Homepage performance](design/performance/index-performance.png)
To further improve performance, I used the lazy loading attribute on the embedded Google maps element and on the desktop image element at the bottom of the page.

## Bugs

1. I ran into an issue with the alignment of the Our Teas panels, wherein I could not get each div for each individual tea to align properly on desktop, regardless of the size of description. For safer and clearer version control I moved to a new branch to experiment. At first I attempted to use fixed height divs but this created another issue wherein the divs no longer lined up vertically on mobile. I reverted to the original to remove any changes made during the first attempt, and secondly tried to solve the problem using CSS alignment. I made all the divs display as inline-block elements to try and use flexbox to line them up properly and responsively in the Bootstrap grid on all devices. This did not work as the divs no longer held together in an equally spaced and clean grid system, and I could not make them line up vertically with the description alongside the image, uniquely to the tablet view. I attempted to use the min-content and max-content CSS properties to create equally sized divs for each tea on desktop, but this further complicated the layout problem on tablet styles. I solved the problem by placing each individual tea menu item in its own row as opposed to columns within a row, giving both the image and description its own Bootstrap column, and lining them up differently based on screen size. This allowed me to use a combination of Bootstrap alignment classes and media queries to create responsive divs for each menu item, that can easily change layout on different sizes, and use a fixed height on desktop for a cleaner, equal aesthetic. 

##### Old Code 

```
<div class="row tea mx-3">

<div class="col">

<img src="assets/images/oolong1.webp" class="tea-leaves" alt="Oolong tea leaves">

<h3>Da Hong Pao</h3>

<p>One of the most famous oolong teas, and for good reason. This tea is prized in

China for its uniquely prominent mineral taste, and a rich, malty, roasted

flavour. Perfect for the colder seasons!</p>

</div>

</div>

```

##### New Code

```
<div class="row tea align-top d-lg-inline-block mx-lg-3">

<div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">

<img src="assets/images/oolong1.webp" class="tea-leaves" alt="Oolong tea leaves">

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-12">

<h3>Da Hong Pao <span class="badge bg-danger">New!</span></h3>

<p>One of the most famous oolong teas, and for good reason. This tea is prized in

China for its uniquely prominent mineral taste, and a rich, malty, roasted

flavour. Perfect for the colder seasons!</p>

</div>

</div>
```


The only other bugs encountered during the project were firstly a minor text size and overflow issue that was resolved by switching from fixed pixel font sizes to a more responsive em size unit, and layout mismatches that were resolved by making small changes within the Bootstrap grid layout.
