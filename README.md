## Design

### Design Choices

My layout decisions were informed by development principles of presenting clear accessible information, using repetition and contrast to create a memorable and easily navigated site, and first-look learning. My decisions on the style and theming of the website were informed by the perspective of the site owner wanting to create a certain brand image; I have aimed for a relaxing, sophisticated aesthetic for a culturally leaning business. 

### Colours

I have chosen an analogous colour scheme for the site, emphasising a simplicity and gentle atmosphere that matches the brand image. The colours chosen are muted and warm pastel colours, intended to be soothing, with a darker accent colour to create some contrast and draw attention to structural layout information. I chose a yellow analogous colour scheme for a positive and relaxing tone.

Main theme colour: #fbefcc
Accent theme colour: #f7e09d

### Fonts

My two fonts for the website were selected from Google Fonts' sans-serif collection. I wanted to use fonts that presented a very clean, spacious look for the headings and text. The fonts I chose were those that I felt best matched the cohesive brand theming of the website and the accessibility focused design principles that informed the entire design process. I chose a more stylistic, lightweight typeface for the headings as the text is both larger, and thus easier to read, and more prominent as an aesthetic presence on the page.

### Structure 

The website is designed to feel like one cohesive page, as much as that is possible. I have focused on consistency across all four pages of the site, again, as much as possible; each page shares a header and footer, uses the same design for page headings, and follows the same basic layout principles using the Bootstrap grid system. The website is navigated by using a clear, easy-to-use navigation bar at the top of the page. This principle of a consistent site experience is also the reason I chose to display the different content on the 'Our Teas' page as tabpanels with its own navigation bar; I aimed to create a similar experience navigating to different pages as the user has when changing tabs, where only the necessary content changes. 

The content I considered important enough to remain consistent across all pages is as follows:

- A header with the site logo, and on desktop an additional title for the page the user is currently viewing
- A navigation bar to access the different pages of the site
- A footer with the business address to be more memorable
- A short business tagline to reinforce the business ethos
- Links to the business social media pages

The site consists of four different pages and a unique 404 error page.

1. Homepage - a memorable landing page to grip the user's attention and communicate useful information on first glance
2. Our Teas - a menu page that shows users what teas are on offer at the business 
3. Events - a page that shows both upcoming and past events, advertising the kind of events people are able to attend, and showcasing the events space to potential tenants
4. Contact - a contact form for questions and business inquiries
