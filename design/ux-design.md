# UX Design Planning

## Project Idea

A website for a local teahouse called Tea & Time. The business is a local teahouse that offers customers a range of teas to choose from and a seating area. The business hosts a small space that local art and community projects can rent for small performances or exhibitions that customers can take part in. The website's target audiences are individual customers and local projects. We want to invite individuals to visit the teahouse as a social space and as a venue for small events. We want to invite local projects to use the teahouse as a venue to host small events. The goals of the website are to increase the number of visitors to the teahouse and to advertise the opportunity to rent space for performance and art in the teahouse.
